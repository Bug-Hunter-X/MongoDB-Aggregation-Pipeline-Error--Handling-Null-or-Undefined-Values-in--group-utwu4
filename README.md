# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Error: Handling Null or Undefined Values in $group

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines when dealing with null or undefined values within the `$group` stage.  The provided code shows an incorrect aggregation that leads to inaccurate results.  The solution showcases how to correctly handle these scenarios.

## Bug Description

The primary issue lies in the absence of a stage to properly handle potential null or undefined values in a field before the `$group` stage.  If the field contains null or undefined values, the `$group` stage may not function as expected leading to incorrect counts or unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The solution addresses the problem by adding a stage that filters out or replaces null or undefined values using the `$ifNull` or `$cond` operators before the `$group` stage. This ensures accurate aggregation results.
